/// AesopDemo is a small example application that provides a practical

/// @defgroup AesopTest AesopTest
///
/// This module contains a suite of unit tests written with googletest. They
/// are used when developing, to make sure that modifications to the Aesop
/// classes do not break its intended functionality. If you don't plan on
/// modifying any of the source code in the Aesop module, then you shouldn't
/// need to worry about any of this code.
