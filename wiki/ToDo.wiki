#summary Itinerary of tasks and improvements.

= To Do =

 * Demo: parse PDDL files
    * Use STRIPS subset like [http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/ipc-learn/documents/strips-pddl-subset.pdf this] or [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~patrik/pddlman/writing.html this]
       * Support requirements `strips`, `equality`, and maybe `typing`
       * Implement a `substrips` requirement for very simple predicate use? (i.e., `predicate: value` instead of `predicate(value): true/false`)
    * Implement in separate project from demo as standalone library
 * Benchmarking app
    * Separate from demo?
    * Possible: generate random planning problems? [http://www.loria.fr/~hoffmanj/ff-domains.html Like so]
    * Plans-per-second metric?
       * Threaded?
 * Predicates
    * Support flexible, user-defined predicates
    * Retain basic, high-performance ones as well
    * Support logical expressions in effects and preconditions
