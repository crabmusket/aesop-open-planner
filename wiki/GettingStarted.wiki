= Getting Started =

This page goes over the basic process of getting Aesop installed and compiling in your environment.

== Get the code ==

First, grab the source code from [http://code.google.com/p/aesop-open-planner/source/ this site] using your favourite SVN client. The recommended method of using Aesop is to just add all the files from the Aesop/ directory into your own project, no need to compile a library.

== CMake ==

If you wish to compile the AesopTest or AesopDemo applications, [http://www.cmake.org CMake] files have been provided to set up projects. Simply run CMake with the source directory set to the trunk directory of your SVN checkout, and point it to a convenient build directory. I usually use trunk/Build/Win32 or /x86Unix.

== Testing ==

The AesopTest project that comes with this project is based on the [http://code.google.com/p/gogletest googletest] project. To make sure Aesop runs properly, especially if you have made modifications to the source, compile and run the AesopTest project generated by CMake. Its output will indicate whether all Aesop's components are working as desired.

== Use ==

The BasicTutorial and AdvancedTutorial pages provide detailed walkthroughs on using the Aesop library code in your own application.
