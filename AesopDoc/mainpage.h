/// @mainpage
/// Aesop is a library of classes and functions that implement a STRIPS-like
/// dynamic planner in C++. The goal of the planner is to take an initial world
/// state, a set of actions that operate on the world state, and put together
/// a sequence of actions such that the world is transformed into some desired
/// final state.
